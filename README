Ludum Dare 25 Jam Event

"Trios"

You control "Trios" to its captured prey, a (virtual) goat. You're already in your domain. But the path to each of your prey is kind da difficult to your clumsy move. 

Just kick-butt it, next prey is awaiting. 

There's 5 levels currently.

- Control keys -
Each column maps to each leg of Trios. 
Q, W, E -> Hold to keep pullin up individual leg of robot (in y-axis only) 
A, S, D -> Move individual leg to the right (in positive x-axis) 
Z, X, C -> Same as A,S,D but in opposite direction 
R -> If you hopeless, you will need this. 

- Rules - 
1. At least 1 foot must touch the ground in order to pull up another. 
2. To move forward, you have to "pull" up target leg first, then while it's in the air you "move" it to the right or left. 
3. From 2, that means we cannot just move forward without "pull" up legs. 
4. Enjoy!
